### Planning and Wireframing

In the initial stages of RoamMates development, we carefully planned our approach to ensure a smooth and efficient process. Utilizing wireframes, we visualized the layout and structure of our application before diving into development.

The wireframes served as a blueprint for our User Experience (UX) design, allowing us to map out user interactions and interface elements. This deliberate planning phase played a crucial role in shaping the user journey and refining our ideas before implementation.

### Development Phases

Our development process was divided into two main phases:

1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** We dedicated the first week to building the core functionalities necessary for RoamMates to function as a basic travel buddy matching platform. This approach allowed us to swiftly launch a working version and gather valuable feedback.

2. **Additional Features:** With a solid foundation in place, we allocated the following week to implement additional features and refine the user experience. This phase focused on enhancing user engagement.

By adopting this iterative development approach, we aimed to deliver a functional and user-friendly application within the defined two-week deadline. Our continuous focus on both MVP and additional features ensured a balance between a quick release and a feature-rich product.
